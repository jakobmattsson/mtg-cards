Fetch scripts
* get LSV review
* get full info file (via the API)
* get images from full info file
* get images from review file  --- maybe do the same as above (just getting from a different property)


Apps

* Visualize per color/quality (and show rarity) -- with cards on hover






Review files are lists of:
* title
* imageUrl
* lowScore

Show rarity correctly
