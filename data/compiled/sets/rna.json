Not only is this a huge flash flyer that is cheap and great at ambushing, it can also save you in even the most dire situations. You could take a lot away from this card and it would still be great, which is a sign of a true bomb. If you draw this early, you can pick off an attacker and start smashing the opponent. Later in the game, it saves you from lethal, and you may even want to trade this off (or chump) so that you can go back up to 10 on your next turn. This is a great card, and one that does well in almost any situation."},

That can lead to a weird lock where that's all players do, but even then I don't think this is really a card you want in your deck.

That said, you can put something large into play or cast Emergency Powers at the end of the opponent's turn, and both of those break the symmetry somewhat. I suspect this isn't a card you want to play, but some strange control decks may be able to make use of it."},

That is a ton of rate and abilities, making me think this got moved from uncommon at some point in the process. Either way, I'm in a frenzy thinking about getting decks with two or three of these, as they are huge threats at any point in the game. You mostly want this as a 4/4, but there are definitely games where the haste mode is better."},

Turn 5 Nikya, turn 6 dump your hand of creatures is a nice play pattern, and it isn't like the opponent can ignore a 5/5 either, so you will unlock your spells. I could see Nikya being an even bigger bomb, deckbuilding constraints and all. Note that you can use the extra mana on adapt, which is absurd too."},
