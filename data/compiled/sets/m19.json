In a dedicated ramp/control deck, this is an awesome finisher. I love when there are powerful cards that only some decks can use, and give them bonus points for being 7-mana Golems (I have a soft spot for those).","color":"gold","set":"m19","rarity":"uncommon","instant":"","removal":"removal"},

Don't put this in a normal deck, and try and find better finishers for your Draft control decks. Milling them only helps them unless you kill them (since there are various graveyard synergies) and this doesn't combine with very many other cards when it comes to finishing the game. It's also not super fast, so you aren't racing with this.","color":"gold","set":"m19","rarity":"uncommon","instant":"","removal":""},

Sometimes your opponent eats the 2/2 token you make and it's not too exciting, but sometimes they don't and you win on the spot. It pairs well with flyers and removal both, and can go into any creature-based deck and be very good.","color":"gold","set":"m19","rarity":"rare","instant":"","removal":""},
