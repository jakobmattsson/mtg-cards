For that deck to be successful, you're going to want enough 2-drops so that this works out well. Mentor on a 3-power creature is basically free in that regard, and I don't expect it to require you to draft very differently than you would otherwise. In a defensive deck, this becomes a lot less interesting, which is true of most mentor creatures."},

That's playable in the right beatdown deck, so that's where the rating comes from."},

Buffing your mentor creatures can open the door to some nice plays, and this is a lot of stats if the opponent can't easily snap off a 2-for-1."},

This looks like it will punish Golgari and Selesnya more than others, though every guild has creatures that you can arrest."},

I like playing one of these in removal-light decks, and am happy to pick up extra copies for the sideboard."},

Even if you always pay full retail, this will be a solid card, and the turns where you get to convoke this out are going to be filthy. Curving into this for free on turn 4 or 5 will dramatically swing most games, and this is good no matter when you draw it."},

This gives you lifelink chumpers that keep you alive, and you get to draw extra cards whenever theSoldiers go into combat, which helps you hit land drops and make more Soldiers. It's a self-fueling engine, and will win any long game easily, while still having an impact as early as the midgame. You can lose fast games with this in play, but whenever it's on the other side of the board, you will feel the crushing grip of inevitability approaching (Mr. Anderson)."},

In an aggro deck, this is great removal, and will assist in you curving out and crushing the opponent. In a midrange or control deck, it's close to blank, and that explains the disparate ratings."},

In a deck without token-making, this does literal zero, but if you can make two Angels you end up very far ahead. Sadly, the card file doesn't support this all that well-white and green just don't have much in the way of tokens, so I'm not convinced that this is something you can slam early. The best enabler is Sworn Companions, so if you have a couple of copies and see Divine Visitation, I'd go for it."},

You don't need millions of creatures for this to be good, and even your average Boros deck will be happy running this as top end."},

Playing this plus another creature or removal spell on turn 4 is a huge swing, especially if it lets your creatures attack when they otherwise couldn't."},

But given enough support from mentor creatures and pump spells, this can be a sick threat. 1/1s for 1 get a lot better with mentor as a mechanic, and this plays exactly into that game plan."},

Well, the bird is the word once you add mentor and convoke to the mix, so I'm actually high on the hawk. This isn't bad by itself, and becomes great if you can get a +1/+1 counter or two on it, or tap it to convoke out something large. I suspect these will still be a tad overdrafted, but at least they are a good addition to your deck."},

Plus, the flavor is great-a witness dies, prompting the Boros Legion to investigate."},

The next turn, you have the Packbeast to attack with, plus your mentor creatures get value from the previous turn's attacks. I wouldn't run this outside of aggro, though it's quite strong as the high end for beatdown."},

Playing this on turn 3 is easy, and in the right draw, this might come out for 0 mana on turn 4 or 5. Plus, 2/4 is a particularly good statline for mentor, which is some nice cross-guild synergy."},

A huge flyer that distributes +1/+1 counters in multiple ways is something I'm in the market for, and if it gives you a little extra incentive to play white creatures over red or green ones, so be it."},

Your shields may be down, but your life is up, and that plus solid stats makes it so I won't forget this elephant."},

Granted, you aren't likely to trigger this multiple times most games, but even once is more than enough of a pay off."},

Getting to attack with your 3/1 mentor creature and then casting Righteous Blow (I think this is one two-word card I won't be shortening when describing it) is a good exchange even though your 3/1 doesn't get damage through."},

Pegasus Courser at common every set was getting to be a bit much, and having a break from that is welcome. The card is great, and completely changes how white decks play out, giving them good offense at any stage in the game. It even gets better with mentor, both in receiving counters and giving your fragile mentor creatures evasion."},

Early on, this attacks and trades just fine, and later you will have the mana to send it to the skies. This is an aggressive card, and a good one at that."},

A 2/2 first strike for 2 is good on its own, so don't worry too much if you don't have many mentor targets (though do try and pick up a couple)."},

You do need to put in a little work to make this great, but I swear that it's worth it-once you have a couple of mentor cards or a go-wide pump spell, this will deliver."},

Note that precombat pump spells open up more mentor possibilities, even if you give up some extra life in this case."},

It can make it more likely a mentor creature (or target) survives combat, but that's not enough to make it exciting."},

That makes this a ton of stats for a very low cost, and one of the better threats you can start a Draft with. This will shine in any deck, and be busted in a curve-out aggro deck."}
