It's a self-fueling engine, and will win any long game easily, while still having an impact as early as the midgame. You can lose fast games with this in play, but whenever it's on the other side of the board, you will feel the crushing grip of inevitability approaching (Mr. Anderson)."},

Counterspells get much worse the more mana they cost, and 4 is enough that you really get punished when you leave it up and don't get to counter something.

At a baseline, if you're playing an aggressive deck you should probably run this, and if you ever snipe more than one creature at once it's excellent. Control decks don't want this, and you have to be selective while sideboarding-against some decks this will be awesome."},

Cancel is usually slightly below the bar-add a surveil and all of a sudden it's above it."},

Not only will it grow to threatening proportions, a cheap defensive body is exactly what a deck full of fiddly surveil cards wants. This is bound to be underrated, and I'm a big fan."},

Bounce plus surveil is a great deal for 2 mana, and I'd be happy to run multiples."},

This can help you push through damage and make profitable attacks, especially when you add some combat tricks to the mix. Blue isn't the best color for this, as it would be a lot more exciting in white."},

As far as defensive plays go, this is one of the better ones."},

It's a sizable body and surveil 2 is pretty close to drawing a card in the mid-to-late game."},

A vanilla 2/5 is just not that exciting, and you can do better almost all the time."}
