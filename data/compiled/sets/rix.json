That said, some decks just don't want tricks, so sometimes this won't make the cut."},

It might be slow enough that it's closer to a 3.5 in Draft, but I can't imagine cutting it from a B/W deck, and I will be taking it early. I've seen it be insane in Sealed every time it's cast, and know it's a windmill slam there. Is the profane part what the opponent thinks when you play this?"},
