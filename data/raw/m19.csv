It's a good way to spend turn 2 in a deck without low drops, and it smooths out your draws, but you won't always have space for it. Unlike Opt in Dominaria, there isn't a heavy spells-matter component, which is why Opt ended up being much stronger in that format.

Two bodies, one of which flies, is a great deal for 3 mana, and I'm going to be happy casting a lot of these.

Leaving this up on turns 4-6 and having the opponent tap out for a noncreature spell can lose you the game on the spot, and if the format is fast, you often won't have the luxury of leaving it up to begin with. That said, it's powerful in a slow format or in slow matchups, and it definitely will have a place. I'm cool on this to start, but I have my eye on it-Bone to Ash could easily end up being a solid main deck card.

It does die to a stiff breeze, but most spells that target will have killed this anyway, so I don't see that as a huge drawback. This is great early as a clock, and great late as a way to get a ton of damage in out of nowhere.
