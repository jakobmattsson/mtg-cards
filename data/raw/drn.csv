9,"Once you have three Izzet Guildgates, you can move Niv-Mizzet to a flat 5.0-the mana cost is all that's keeping this back, since it is a harsh one.

Secondly, she's a 2/5 flyer for 4, which happens to be very appealing stats. Lastly, she has mentor, which means that she generates value every time she swings. Note that she can target herself with her trigger, making her a 4/5 flyer with vigilance, which is perfect for any mentoring you are looking for.

7,"This is a brutal split card. It's a 2-for-1 later in the game by casting double Raise Dead, something Golgari can use easily, and if needed it's a really powerful sweeper. Giving one of your creatures permanent +2/+2 makes it quite likely to survive the -4/-4, and that's a big enough minus that almost everything else should die.

She comes in with high loyalty if you use the +2 ability, and all that's really lacking is her ability to defend herself against larger threats. That's all that's keeping her from being a bomb, as she's not a great play into a 4-cost flyer or a Siege Wurm if you don't have a bunch of other ways to defend her.

This does get docked some for being both hard to cast and requiring spell support, but that is Izzet's jam, and having to take a Guildgate a little higher is well worth what you're getting here.

Making just two bugs (and I have the perfect token for you) is enough, as that's three bodies, good total stats, and a powerful sacrifice ability. Once you are getting 3+ bugs, Izoni will take over the game, and that shouldn't be too hard to pull off by turn 6.

It's a self-fueling engine, and will win any long game easily, while still having an impact as early as the midgame.

4.2,"This being restricted to just black cards makes it too situational for my tastes-there will be many games where you can't cast this early, and even in the midgame it might be off. Add to that the problem that your best cards may not even be black, and the problem gets worse.",75,Mausoleum Secrets,drn,black,rare,instant,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Mausoleum Secrets.png
4,"This is going to end a lot of games, but at least you have to work for it. Convoke doesn't look as good as it was in previous incarnations because there are fewer good token makers, but that doesn't mean this 9-drop can't reliably be cast for 6-or-so mana. That's a good enough deal that I'm sold, and there are some control decks that will have a hell of a time trying to stop this.",122,Arboretum Elemental,drn,green,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Arboretum Elemental.png
3.75,"A 3-mana 2/4 is a card most white decks wouldn't mind, and this can often be better than that. Playing this on turn 3 is easy, and in the right draw, this might come out for 0 mana on turn 4 or 5. Plus, 2/4 is a particularly good statline for mentor, which is some nice cross-guild synergy.",18,Ledev Guardian,drn,white,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Ledev Guardian.png
3.75,"I'm pretty down on this one. It's a combat trick that costs 5 mana and doesn't add any stats, making it extremely situational and hard to hold up until the late game. It does wreck sweepers, but that's not enough to get me to put the shields up.",181,Join Shields,drn,green+white,uncommon,instant,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Join Shields.png
3.75,"Adding convoke to Fog doesn't really get me excited, as the effect is still way too situational. If the opponent has a massive Overrun effect, like Bounty of Might, you may want to side this in, but even then I'd be hesitant.",140,Pause for Reflection,drn,green,common,instant,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Pause for Reflection.png
3.5,"Please, just trust me-this isn't worth 1 mana, no matter how many different (minor) things it does. This is exactly the kind of card that looks super appealing, but besides the discard, all of the other effects aren't worth anything (and in the case of milling them for one, can actually be a disadvantage).",89,Vicious Rumors,drn,black,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Vicious Rumors.png
3.5,"If you're jamming Boros Locket, you're probably doing it wrong. Boros decks tend to have a low curve and don't care about card draw, so this stands markedly behind the rest of the Lockets.",231,Boros Locket,drn,artifact,common,,,,fixing,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Boros Locket.png
2,"At 5 mana, this looks pricey to me. The red decks don't seem that focused on going wide, and even though trample is nice, you need to have good creatures before it really pays off.",117,Street Riot,drn,red,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Street Riot.png
1,"I was going to do those little clappy hand things in between each word, but that's just so unbelievably annoying that I think I'll skip it. Please, just don't play Surgical Extraction effects like this in Limited. It's not worth being down a card, and your opponent's deck will rarely ever rely on one card so much that you can spend 3 mana and a card on this effect.",212,Unmoored Ego,drn,blue+black,rare,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Unmoored Ego.png
