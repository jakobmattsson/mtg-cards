Aggressive Urge,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6422010/large/155761_200w.jpg?1515181103,2.5,,"Aggressive Urge is going to drastically impact attacking and blocking over the course of the format. Trading for a trick is one thing, but being down a card is a completely different animal. This is cheap enough that any combats swung by +1/+1 are much sketchier against open green mana, which should lead to a lot more ""no blocks."" When a good combat trick has this potential, it rightfully changes how people play. That said, some decks just don't want tricks, so sometimes this won't make the cut.",green,rix,,,

Hunt the Weak is a nice combo, thanks to the high toughness, and it even lets you untap a land. Dino decks will definitely run this, as will most green decks.",green,rix,,,

You aren't paying much for the ability, as a 2/1 for 2 is good, but it's hard for things to line up where you have mana up, a Dinosaur, and a fight you want to instigate, all at the right time. Still, the opponent will play scared, making this a card most decks will indeed cherish.",green,rix,,,
Colossal Dreadmaw,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6422013/large/155769_200w.jpg?1515181110,2.5,,"This is slightly worse than Carnage Tyrant, mainly because of the lesser stats and lack of great abilities. It's still a perfectly acceptable finisher, and a card I'll play multiples of in a ramp deck. It doesn't even sound bad to play one in a red-green beatdown deck, as a 6/6 trample is no laughing matter for the opponent.",green,rix,common,,

Jadelight Ranger,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6421797/large/155595_200w.jpg?1514937665,3.5,,"This is like a Mulldrifter/Tarmogoyf split card, to use absolutely no hyperbole. In terms of useful analysis, Jadelight Ranger can never miss-it either draws you lands or is big, and makes the top of your deck better. That's a lot for 3 mana, and you can even ensure that it's a 4/3 if you hit a nonland on the first explore. This is a fantastic 3-drop, and an early pick.",green,rix,,,
Jungleborn Pioneer,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6422033/large/155780_200w.jpg?1515181166,3,,"Jungleborn Pioneer is more than just a token 3-drop, and it may be the best way to halt the opponent's offense at common. It interacts well against menace creatures, 4/2s, and 2/1s, while still trading for the plethora of 3/3s for 3. It also gives you a hexproof token for Aura shenanigans, if you are running those. I like this in any green deck, and have been very impressed so far.",green,rix,,,

But if the opponent doesn't have a kill spell, it gets out of control quickly. It makes you ascend almost immediately, and then makes two 3/3s per turn cycle (note that it triggers on their turn too). That's a lot of finishing power and an immediate reward.",green,rix,,,

Outside of Dinos, it's not worth playing, unless you had a busted deck that required splashing. 3 is too much to pay for this effect, while 2 is exciting.",green,rix,,,
Wayward Swordtooth,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6422068/large/155797_200w.jpg?1515181253,1.5,,"Wayward Swordtooth is tricky, but it's worth exploring. When things go right and you have 6 lands in play on turn 4, this looks good, since you're likely to flood the board and hit the city's blessing on turn 5 or 6. When you're short on lands, this is a total blank, and that's what worries me. It at least is a fine topdeck in the late game, and in Dino decks, could fight alongside 6+ drop Dinos and a high land count.",green,rix,,,

It largely doesn't work until you're at 5 or less life, and can sit dead in your hand for long enough that it seems weak.

It isn't in a supported tribe, but besides that, this is a great card no matter what kind of deck you're playing. Blocking well and attacking without fear makes this an awesome 3-drop. It's basically True-Name Nemesis, though slightly better because it doesn't die to -1/-1 effects.",white,rix,,,

Playing this as a 2-mana 3/3 blocker is great, and if you have a couple incidental sources of life gain, he can bash in for a ton of damage.

I'm not super excited about it in Dino ramp because it doesn't block well and you usually don't need that much help winning with your 6-drops. Red-white seems like the natural home here, as this could give the deck the last bits of reach it needs. Also, ""heliopterus""? At that point, couldn't you just call it a helicopter?",white,rix,,,

If you have it in play, your opponent can't attack without giving you some good value, and when the Paladin dies, you get a nice bit of life back. It starts to get nuts once you have cards that let you pay life, but even straight-up I think this will end up playing well.",white,rix,,,
Pride of Conquerors,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6421950/large/155740_200w.jpg?1515173829,1.5,,"Ascend is a tricky mechanic to evaluate. In the normal case, you aren't ascending almost ever in a game of Limited, so the bonus for ascending doesn't seem that likely to occur. But there are cards that generate Treasure and other tokens, which makes ascending a little reliable, at which point you can really start to pay attention to what you're getting. For the most part, I don't want to play ascend cards that aren't good without the city's blessing, and this is one that is fairly mediocre as such. This does push you to make a deck that will hit 10 permanents more often, so bump this in value if your deck looks well-suited for that.",white,rix,,,

It's the most effective on Vampires, but any tribe of small creatures you can go deep on will work. Dinos don't need it quite as much, but it's still a solid bonus there.

The drawback is that you have to fight, so your primal instincts may get you killed if they keep playing creatures. The key with this is to end the game after playing it, which makes it a little different than most control finishers. The power level is here, but you do need some creatures to close out the game before you run out of life points.

This card is neat, but very cuttable, because of how much help it needs to be good.

I could see this going 0.5 in either direction, based on how fast things end up being, and like it a lot in Sealed.",gold,rix,,,
Golden Guardian,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6421881/large/155698_200w.jpg?1515091950,2.5,,"In a defensive deck, this is a very sweet win condition, and is another card that could easily go up in value. If the opponent ever gives you a window to flip this, it's worth losing 2 creatures, as you get to start pumping out Golems until they get crushed. Also note that the land taps for 2 mana, which is a nice little bonus.",gold,rix,,,

It is weak to artifact removal, and you lose the ability to pass it back and forth, but it's a nice aggressive equipment at a good rate. It forces double-blocks and the two points of power means that it'll often be a 2-for-1.",gold,rix,,,

It isn't zero-cost, but it's a low cost, and has a powerful enough effect that I'm often going to risk it. Cards like this give you a game plan, and you pay so little for that option that I like it, even if it's very slow.
