1,Blade Instructor,grn,white,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Blade Instructor.png,2,,"I'd be happy enough running this in any aggressive deck. For that deck to be successful, you're going to want enough 2-drops so that this works out well. Mentor on a 3-power creature is basically free in that regard, and I don't expect it to require you to draft very differently than you would otherwise. In a defensive deck, this becomes a lot less interesting, which is true of most mentor creatures."
2,Bounty Agent,grn,white,rare,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Bounty Agent.png,2,,"The ability on this doesn't have any targets below rare (I guess commons and uncommons don't bring a big enough bounty), so this is mostly just a 2/2 vigilance for 2. That's playable in the right beatdown deck, so that's where the rating comes from."
3,Candlelight Vigil,grn,white,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Candlelight Vigil.png,1,,"This can't hold a candle to removal, which is why it gets a low rating, though be aware that it can be a solid sideboard card against decks that are lacking in ways to interact. Buffing your mentor creatures can open the door to some nice plays, and this is a lot of stats if the opponent can't easily snap off a 2-for-1."
4,Citywide Bust,grn,white,rare,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Citywide Bust.png,2.5,,"Against some decks, this will be a bust, though I do like that it's a sweeper that you can play in aggro decks. This looks like it will punish Golgari and Selesnya more than others, though every guild has creatures that you can arrest."
5,Collar the Culprit,grn,white,common,instant,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Collar the Culprit.png,2,,"The targeted version is a little worse, because the upside isn't quite as high, though it being an instant is a bonus. I like playing one of these in removal-light decks, and am happy to pick up extra copies for the sideboard."
6,Conclave Tribunal,grn,white,uncommon,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Conclave Tribunal.png,4,,"Unconditional removal that might cost 1 or even 0 mana is really high on my list when it comes to Limited, and Conclave Tribunal offers just that. Even if you always pay full retail, this will be a solid card, and the turns where you get to convoke this out are going to be filthy. Curving into this for free on turn 4 or 5 will dramatically swing most games, and this is good no matter when you draw it."
7,Crush Contraband,grn,white,uncommon,instant,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Crush Contraband.png,1,,I like this as a sideboard card. I dislike this having a creepy Boros mask dude on it.
8,Dawn of Hope,grn,white,rare,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Dawn of Hope.png,3.5,,"Dawn of Hope reminds me a little of Mastery of the Unseen, though I suspect it's not insanely broken like Mastery was. This gives you lifelink chumpers that keep you alive, and you get to draw extra cards whenever theSoldiers go into combat, which helps you hit land drops and make more Soldiers. It's a self-fueling engine, and will win any long game easily, while still having an impact as early as the midgame. You can lose fast games with this in play, but whenever it's on the other side of the board, you will feel the crushing grip of inevitability approaching (Mr. Anderson)."
9,Demotion,grn,white,uncommon,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Demotion.png,1,3,"This may not look like it deserves a build-around grade, but it's such a focused aggro card that I feel it warrants one. In an aggro deck, this is great removal, and will assist in you curving out and crushing the opponent. In a midrange or control deck, it's close to blank, and that explains the disparate ratings."
10,Divine Visitation,grn,white,mythic,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Divine Visitation.png,1,3,"As far as build-arounds go, this one is divine. In a deck without token-making, this does literal zero, but if you can make two Angels you end up very far ahead. Sadly, the card file doesn't support this all that well-white and green just don't have much in the way of tokens, so I'm not convinced that this is something you can slam early. The best enabler is Sworn Companions, so if you have a couple of copies and see Divine Visitation, I'd go for it."
11,Flight of Equenauts,grn,white,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Flight of Equenauts.png,3.5,,"I'd definitely pay 6 mana for this, and be quite happy at 5 or less, which makes this a great convoke incentive. You don't need millions of creatures for this to be good, and even your average Boros deck will be happy running this as top end."
12,Gird for Battle,grn,white,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Gird for Battle.png,2,,"You have to be aggressive to really make this gird, but if you are it can be a game-changer. Playing this plus another creature or removal spell on turn 4 is a huge swing, especially if it lets your creatures attack when they otherwise couldn't."
13,Haazda Marshal,grn,white,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Haazda Marshal.png,1,2.5,"By itself, Haazda Marshal is horrendous, and even in a normal deck with a bunch of creatures, it might not be good enough. But given enough support from mentor creatures and pump spells, this can be a sick threat. 1/1s for 1 get a lot better with mentor as a mechanic, and this plays exactly into that game plan."
14,Healer's Hawk,grn,white,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Healer's Hawk.png,2,3,"I bet you're all ready to hear about how this card is a trap and how you shouldn't play it. Well, the bird is the word once you add mentor and convoke to the mix, so I'm actually high on the hawk. This isn't bad by itself, and becomes great if you can get a +1/+1 counter or two on it, or tap it to convoke out something large. I suspect these will still be a tad overdrafted, but at least they are a good addition to your deck."
15,Hunted Witness,grn,white,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Hunted Witness.png,1.5,,"Most decks won't be on the hunt for this, but it does a fine job filling out curves for both of the guilds in its color. Plus, the flavor is great-a witness dies, prompting the Boros Legion to investigate."
16,Inspiring Unicorn,grn,white,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Inspiring Unicorn.png,3.5,,"Inspiring Unicorn is a fierce attacker, and even benefits from its own ability-that's perfect for any deck looking to go wide, and good even without a token theme."
17,Intrusive Packbeast,grn,white,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Intrusive Packbeast.png,2.5,,"Tapping down two blockers opens the doors for attacks on almost any board, and with mentor, one opening is often all you need. The next turn, you have the Packbeast to attack with, plus your mentor creatures get value from the previous turn's attacks. I wouldn't run this outside of aggro, though it's quite strong as the high end for beatdown."
18,Ledev Guardian,grn,white,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Ledev Guardian.png,3,,"A 3-mana 2/4 is a card most white decks wouldn't mind, and this can often be better than that. Playing this on turn 3 is easy, and in the right draw, this might come out for 0 mana on turn 4 or 5. Plus, 2/4 is a particularly good statline for mentor, which is some nice cross-guild synergy."
19,Light of the Legion,grn,white,rare,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Light of the Legion.png,4,,"I wouldn't worry too much about just drafting white creaturesthis is great in any deck, and its death trigger is a bonus. A huge flyer that distributes +1/+1 counters in multiple ways is something I'm in the market for, and if it gives you a little extra incentive to play white creatures over red or green ones, so be it."
20,Loxodon Restorer,grn,white,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Loxodon Restorer.png,3,,"I'm a big fan of Loxodon Restorer, largely because the life gain makes up for tapping all of your creatures to get it into play. Your shields may be down, but your life is up, and that plus solid stats makes it so I won't forget this elephant."
21,Luminous Bonds,grn,white,common,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Luminous Bonds.png,3.5,,"As always, this is one of the best commons in the set, and nothing going on in Ravnica changes that."
22,Parhelion Patrol,grn,white,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Parhelion Patrol.png,3,,"Parhelion Patrol would be sweet without mentor, so adding that keyword makes it an appealing common. Granted, you aren't likely to trigger this multiple times most games, but even once is more than enough of a pay off."
23,Righteous Blow,grn,white,common,instant,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Righteous Blow.png,3,,"It's not a shock that this also pulls its weight, and it does quite well in aggressive or defensive decks. Getting to attack with your 3/1 mentor creature and then casting Righteous Blow (I think this is one two-word card I won't be shortening when describing it) is a good exchange even though your 3/1 doesn't get damage through."
24,Roc Charger,grn,white,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Roc Charger.png,3.5,,"I'm more than happy seeing this at uncommon. Pegasus Courser at common every set was getting to be a bit much, and having a break from that is welcome. The card is great, and completely changes how white decks play out, giving them good offense at any stage in the game. It even gets better with mentor, both in receiving counters and giving your fragile mentor creatures evasion."
25,Skyline Scout,grn,white,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Skyline Scout.png,2.5,,"All I've ever wanted from a 2-drop is that it's relevant late game, and this fits the bill. Early on, this attacks and trades just fine, and later you will have the mana to send it to the skies. This is an aggressive card, and a good one at that."
26,Sunhome Stalwart,grn,white,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Sunhome Stalwart.png,3,,"Once you have this, Healer's Hawk becomes a lot more appealing. A 2/2 first strike for 2 is good on its own, so don't worry too much if you don't have many mentor targets (though do try and pick up a couple)."
27,Sworn Companions,grn,white,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Sworn Companions.png,3,,"This buys you a lot of time in a defensive deck, and gives you some nice mentor targets in an aggressive one. You do need to put in a little work to make this great, but I swear that it's worth it-once you have a couple of mentor cards or a go-wide pump spell, this will deliver."
28,Take Heart,grn,white,common,instant,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Take Heart.png,2,,"1 mana for +2/+2 has proven to be perfectly serviceable, and I expect this to make the cut in most Boros decks. Note that precombat pump spells open up more mentor possibilities, even if you give up some extra life in this case."
29,Tenth District Guard,grn,white,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Tenth District Guard.png,1.5,,"This is about as replaceable as 2-drops get, which is why I assume it's relegated to the tenth district instead of one of the first nine. It can make it more likely a mentor creature (or target) survives combat, but that's not enough to make it exciting."
30,Venerated Loxodon,grn,white,rare,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Venerated Loxodon.png,4,,"Not only is this a cheap 4/4, it also distributes a couple of +1/+1 counters on its way in (up to a full five). That makes this a ton of stats for a very low cost, and one of the better threats you can start a Draft with. This will shine in any deck, and be busted in a curve-out aggro deck."
31,Capture Sphere,grn,blue,common,instant,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Capture Sphere.png,3,,"I'm fine paying 4 mana for this effect, even if it leaves you vulnerable to bounce or enchantment removal down the line. Blue doesn't usually do much better, at least not at common."
32,Chemister's Insight,grn,blue,uncommon,instant,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Chemister's Insight.png,3,,"I really hope this is good enough, because it looks like a sweet way to get an edge in a longer game. Jump-start is a substantial upgrade to Inspiration, as this does eventually see four cards, albeit for a large mana investment. In order to take full advantage of this, you'll want to be a more controlling deck, and have plenty of ways to stabilize so that you can crush the opponent with all of your extra cards."
33,Citywatch Sphinx,grn,blue,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Citywatch Sphinx.png,3.5,,"Citywatch Sphinx is a large flyer that gives you a nice severance package when it dies. There's nothing wrong with this as your finisher, and requiring only a single blue mana makes it easy to splash as well."
34,Dazzling Lights,grn,blue,common,instant,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Dazzling Lights.png,2,,"If you have enough creatures, this can serve as a solid combat trick. By itself it's card disadvantage, but if you can set up a fight between two creatures of equivalent size, this will dazzle your opponent nicely. Cheap surveil spells are also great with spells-matter and surveil-matters cards, of which both Izzet and Dimir have plenty."
35,Devious Cover-Up,grn,blue,common,instant,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Devious Cover-Up.png,1,,"Decking the opponent by looping two of these sounds amazing, and I will certainly be trying to win based on that. As for this card without those shenanigans, it's a lot less devious, and more clunky-a 4-mana counterspell isn't really where you want to be. Counterspells get much worse the more mana they cost, and 4 is enough that you really get punished when you leave it up and don't get to counter something. I'd basically only run this if your opponent has a bunch of insane expensive spells or if you really are going for the decking achievement."
36,Dimir Informant,grn,blue,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Dimir Informant.png,3,,"I love Dimir Informant. A solid defensive body plus card selection makes this a highly desirable 3-drop for every deck that isn't completely aggressive. This works well without any surveil synergies, and gets even better once you add those. Don't sleep on this one-it won't go late in packs."
37,Disdainful Stroke,grn,blue,common,instant,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Disdainful Stroke.png,2.5,,"The first Disdainful Stroke isn't bad, especially against all the guilds that aren't Boros. They do get a lot worse in multiples, because of the risk of them being dead, so I wouldn't prioritize this in the Draft. In Sealed, I'd always run two and might even run three-every deck is going to have a lot of good expensive cards to snipe."
38,Dream Eater,grn,blue,mythic,instant,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Dream Eater.png,4.5,,"This is aptly-named, as it will devour the hopes and dreams of your opponent. The combination of card selection, a big flyer (at instant speed no less) and a bounce spell is really hard to fight. This is incredible at any point in the game, regardless of whether you're ahead or behind, and digs you to whatever else you need. That makes this a certified bomb, and a card you'll rarely want to pass."
39,Drowned Secrets,grn,blue,rare,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Drowned Secrets.png,1,3,"This is a classic build-around, and a throwback to Dimir's strategy from OG Ravnica. If you can pair this with blue jump-start cards and a good defensive deck, it's a solid win condition, and punishing against opposing surveil decks."
40,Enhanced Surveillance,grn,blue,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Enhanced Surveillance.png,1,2,"I'm trying to figure out what a surveil deck really does with this, and I'm not quite sure. You still need a good way to win because this doesn't provide that, even with the ability to stop you from decking. Plus, surveil 4 isn't that much better than surveil 2, so I'm not very excited about the prospect of Enhanced Surveillance (both in this set and in real life)."
41,Guild Summit,grn,blue,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Guild Summit.png,1,3.5,"I'm super hyped for Guild Summit. Making all of your Gates into cantrips sounds awesome, and there could be a sick deck there. I especially like that it pays you for Gates in play and ones you draw later, which makes this look like a strong incentive to draft that deck."
42,Leapfrog,grn,blue,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Leapfrog.png,2,,"Leapfrog will attack as a flyer enough of the time that I'm into it, and if you have enough instants it could even leap to your defense. This is better in aggressive decks, and with 3 power, can be a solid clock even by itself."
43,Maximize Altitude,grn,blue,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Maximize Altitude.png,1.5,,"You have to be very aggressive in order to maximize this, though it's possible that spells-matter decks might want a 1-mana jump-start card. I like how much damage this brings to the table, as double Altitude on a key turn can push through a ton of flying beats."
44,Mission Briefing,grn,blue,rare,instant,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Mission Briefing.png,1.5,,"With a ton of cheap spells, this is a playable, but that's not going to be most decks. Note that you still have to pay for the spell, so this is essentially a surveil 2 Recoup that doesn't have flashback. That's fine, but not exciting."
45,Murmuring Mystic,grn,blue,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Murmuring Mystic.png,3.5,,"Now this is a build-around, and given its stats, you don't even need to do that much work. If this makes one or two Birds, you're very far ahead, and in a dedicated jump-start deck this will be obscenely good."
46,Muse Drake,grn,blue,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Muse Drake.png,3,,"Cantrip creatures are my muse, and this is a card I won't often be cutting from my deck. A 1/3 flyer is exactly what you want to keep you alive while you reap the benefits of extra cards, and this is an attractive piece of any blue control deck."
47,Narcomoeba,grn,blue,rare,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Narcomoeba.png,2,,"I don't hate Narcomoeba in a deck with a lot of surveil. Getting a 1/1 flyer for free (no mana or card cost) is a big game, and if you are seeing 6-7 cards a game via surveil, that gives you a decent shot of getting this into play for free."
48,Nightveil Sprite,grn,blue,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Nightveil Sprite.png,3.5,,"Surveil 1 each turn is a big game, and this pecks in for damage while you're at it. Even without the surveil payoffs this is a great card, and I'd be happy to start any Draft with it."
49,Omnispell Adept,grn,blue,rare,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Omnispell Adept.png,1.5,,"Let's leave this one for the Constructed brewers, as you aren't going to be turbo'ing out things like Enter the Infinite in Limited. Still, this is a 3/4 for 5, which doesn't have the worst stats, and does let you play spells at a discount or at instant speed. I'd run this if I was really short on creatures, which does imply a lot of spells, though I wouldn't be looking to try and cheat in off-color spells or anything like that."
50,Passwall Adept,grn,blue,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Passwall Adept.png,1.5,,"This plays both defense and offense, but does neither spectacularly well. I'll pass."
51,Quasiduplicate,grn,blue,rare,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Quasiduplicate.png,3.5,,"Getting two copies of your best creature is a very powerful effect, even if there's more than a hint of win-more to this card. If you can stabilize behind something solid, this will give you a ton of power in the late game."
52,Radical Idea,grn,blue,common,instant,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Radical Idea.png,1.5,,"A real radical idea would be this costing 1 mana, but it's probably for the best that it didn't. I'd only run this if I had a heavy spells-matter theme, as paying 4 mana to draw two and discard one isn't a great deal."
53,Selective Snare,grn,blue,uncommon,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Selective Snare.png,2,,"This is a hard card to evaluate, because it will vary so drastically between matchups. At a baseline, if you're playing an aggressive deck you should probably run this, and if you ever snipe more than one creature at once it's excellent. Control decks don't want this, and you have to be selective while sideboarding-against some decks this will be awesome."
54,Sinister Sabotage,grn,blue,uncommon,instant,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Sinister Sabotage.png,2.5,,"Against all of the guilds except Boros, countering a spell for 3 mana is decent, and the addition of surveil makes this a great value proposition. Cancel is usually slightly below the bar-add a surveil and all of a sudden it's above it."
55,Thoughtbound Phantasm,grn,blue,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Thoughtbound Phantasm.png,1.5,3.5,"In decks with a lot of surveil, this will be one of your better cards. Not only will it grow to threatening proportions, a cheap defensive body is exactly what a deck full of fiddly surveil cards wants. This is bound to be underrated, and I'm a big fan."
56,Unexplained Disappearance,grn,blue,common,instant,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Unexplained Disappearance.png,3,,"This will disappear from packs quickly, but there is a clear explanation-it's a good card and fits well into any deck. Bounce plus surveil is a great deal for 2 mana, and I'd be happy to run multiples."
57,Vedalken Mesmerist,grn,blue,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Vedalken Mesmerist.png,2,,"Vedalken Mesmerist has convinced me that it's going to play well, especially in Izzet. This can help you push through damage and make profitable attacks, especially when you add some combat tricks to the mix. Blue isn't the best color for this, as it would be a lot more exciting in white."
58,Wall of Mist,grn,blue,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Wall of Mist.png,2,,"Sitting behind a Wall of Mist and surveilling sounds like an ideal situation to me, and Chemister's Insight doesn't sound half bad either. As far as defensive plays go, this is one of the better ones."
59,Watcher in the Mist,grn,blue,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Watcher in the Mist.png,3,,"Creepy window peeper or not, this is a card I'll always play. It's a sizable body and surveil 2 is pretty close to drawing a card in the mid-to-late game."
60,Wishcoin Crab,grn,blue,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Wishcoin Crab.png,1,,"One of my wishes for this format is that I never have to play the Crab. A vanilla 2/5 is just not that exciting, and you can do better almost all the time."
61,Barrier of Bones,grn,black,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Barrier of Bones.png,1,,"The barrier for entry is high when it comes to purely defensive plays, and surveil 1 doesn't make up for how small this is. I also don't like 0-power defenders much against mentor, which is making me rethink my rating on Wall of Mist."
62,Bartizan Bats,grn,black,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Bartizan Bats.png,2,,"The last time we saw a 3/1 flyer for 4, it had minor Vampire synergies propping it up. Here, you just have undergrowth, which isn't nothing. This is still pretty fragile, so there's no shame in leaving it out of your deck."
63,Blood Operative,grn,black,rare,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Blood Operative.png,3.5,,"Things are certainly going to get bloody when this thing hits the board, as a 3/1 lifesteal can't be ignored. Your opponent will likely be forced to trade if they want any chance to race, and there are so many surveil cards (28, to be exact) that it won't be hard to bring this back a few times per game. With multiple common Auras that lock this down, don't be afraid to use one of your removal spells on your own Blood Operative if you have ways to get it back."
64,Burglar Rat,grn,black,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Burglar Rat.png,3,,"Ravenous Rats was a staple in every Limited format it appeared in, and I have no reason to believe this one will be different. It always trades for at least a card, and can often get you a few life in a chump block or keep an x/1 at bay. That's a great deal for 2 mana, and is especially nice in decks with undergrowth cards."
65,Child of Night,grn,black,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Child of Night.png,1.5,,"Looking at a lot of the creatures in this set, Child of Night looks a bit lackluster compared to its previous incarnations. It's certainly a playable still, as it will often trade for a card and gain you 2-4 life, but Dimir Informant is its mortal enemy, and there are a lot of cards like that (see: the card directly above this one)."
66,Creeping Chill,grn,black,uncommon,,,face,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Creeping Chill.png,1,,"Most surveil decks aren't in the market for Lava Spike, even a free one that comes with 3 life attached. If your deck is both aggressive and surveil-heavy, maybe this creeps in, but for the most part this should be riding the bench. I suspect that this will be one of the most popular bad cards in the set, as people love the idea of getting something for nothing."
67,Dead Weight,grn,black,common,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Dead Weight.png,3.5,,"If this rating seems high, it's only because you haven't had the pleasure of playing with Dead Weight before. This has a lot more flexibility than Shock, as you can weaken creatures that are too big to outright kill. That more than makes up for the sorcery speed part, and makes this one of the premier black commons. If the format ends up revolving around large creatures, maybe this is a clear second behind Deadly Visit, but the efficiency here is hard to beat."
68,Deadly Visit,grn,black,common,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Deadly Visit.png,3.5,,"Killing anything and getting to surveil 2 is about as close to Annihilate as we are going to get at common. This is excellent removal, and I think I'd take the first one of these over Dead Weight, though I'd likely alternate after that."
69,Doom Whisperer,grn,black,mythic,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Doom Whisperer.png,4.5,,"This shouts more than whispers, as it will end most games where it comes out early (and still seems awesome even late). It's an enormous flyer for cheap, and can find you whatever you need at the low cost of a few life."
70,Douser of Lights,grn,black,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Douser of Lights.png,2,2.5,"Black doesn't usually get creatures as beefy as this, and I'm always in for a Thornhide Wolves. I like the first one of these a lot, though at 5 mana it does conflict with the vastly superior Deadly Visit."
71,Gruesome Menagerie,grn,black,rare,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Gruesome Menagerie.png,1.5,,"If you end up with a couple of good 1-drops, this goes from mediocre playable to quite exciting, so keep an eye out. It's hard to set this up, but the reward is there, and getting a card and mana advantage is well worth spending 5 mana on. It also combos nicely with surveil, as you won't need to have ever cast creatures before playing this."
72,Hired Poisoner,grn,black,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Hired Poisoner.png,2.5,,"As far as defensive plays go, you could do worse with your money. A 1/1 deathtouch keeps the ground clear, and does it cheaply. This plays nicely with undergrowth and helps keep surveil control decks alive, making it a good fit for most black decks."
73,Kraul Swarm,grn,black,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Kraul Swarm.png,3,,"The biggest drawback of a 4/1 flyer is that it dies too easily, and the ability here does quite a bit to mitigate that. It is still clunky to get this back and replay it, but you don't need a 4/1 flyer to live for very long before you win the game. There is also the nice surveil synergy, as you can dump this in your bin early and get it back when you have time to use it."
74,Lotleth Giant,grn,black,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Lotleth Giant.png,2,2,"If this is doing 5+ damage, it's a fantastic finisher. If it's doing a lotleth, I'm not all that excited. As such, I'd want to play this in a deck focused on filling the bin, whether that's an undergrowth deck, a surveil deck, or some combination. This isn't quite a high enough payoff to slam early, but later in the draft will find some takers."
75,Mausoleum Secrets,grn,black,rare,instant,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Mausoleum Secrets.png,1,,"This being restricted to just black cards makes it too situational for my tastes-there will be many games where you can't cast this early, and even in the midgame it might be off. Add to that the problem that your best cards may not even be black, and the problem gets worse."
76,Mephitic Vapors,grn,black,common,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Mephitic Vapors.png,2,,"Mephitic Vapors will be a great sideboard card and a plausible main deck one, depending on how many of your own creatures it kills. Surveil 2 is a nice bonus, so if this kills even one creature you are likely ahead."
77,Midnight Reaper,grn,black,rare,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Midnight Reaper.png,3.5,,"Midnight Reaper isn't optional, just like all grim reapers, but as long as you keep your life total high this is a fantastic card. It turns all of your other creatures into 2-for-1s, and is great when you're chumping with things like Child of Night or Burglar Rat. Against removal, this will be the first to die, but it triggers off of itself, making it a 2-for-1 at worst."
78,Moodmark Painter,grn,black,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Moodmark Painter.png,1.5,,"Undergrowth doesn't seem that well-supported in this set, so I'm wary of the rewards that require a lot of creatures before they pay you off. At least Lotleth Giant costs 7, so you should have a well-stocked graveyard by then, whereas Moodmark Painter really wants to come down early but likely won't grant a whole lot until later. Menace also falls off later in the game, so I'm not really sure how this fits into most decks."
79,Necrotic Wound,grn,black,uncommon,instant,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Necrotic Wound.png,3,,"This card is a lot more appealing. It still doesn't do a ton early, but having a 1 mana removal spell on turn 5 or 6 is still great, and if worse comes to worst this can be used as a combat trick if it's only giving -1/-1 or -2/-2."
80,Never Happened,grn,black,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Never Happened.png,1,,"I'd sideboard this in against slow decks, or main deck it in Sealed. A one-for-one hand disruption spell that costs 3 mana is a bit slow for Draft, so you really want to make sure that the matchup is slow enough for this."
81,Pilfering Imp,grn,black,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Pilfering Imp.png,3,,"I like this little bugger. It gets in for a few points of damage, then you can trade it off for a card in their hand before they hit their high drops. It also enables undergrowth, making this a fine playable for multiple reasons."
82,Plaguecrafter,grn,black,uncommon,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Plaguecrafter.png,2,,"Edict (sacrifice) effects are much worse in Limited than Constructed. Your opponent will be playing more creatures, and specifically more bad ones, making this a lot less effective. It's cute that it can make them discard a card, and eating planeswalkers will definitely have Constructed implications, but for Limited I'd consider this a marginal playable more than anything exciting."
83,Price of Fame,grn,black,uncommon,instant,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Price of Fame.png,4,,"Cutting a mana off of Deadly Visit and making it an instant is enough to get the 0.5 bump, and I expect this to a very high pick. Plus, you may even snipe a legendary creature, at which point the price is definitely right."
84,Ritual of Soot,grn,black,rare,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Ritual of Soot.png,3.5,,"This is awkward against Selesnya, as that deck is full of overcosted creatures, but it should be effective against the other four guilds. Setting this up doesn't seem too hard, and it isn't that bad if you have to kill one or two of your own creatures in the process, especially if you are enabling undergrowth."
85,Severed Strands,grn,black,common,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Severed Strands.png,1.5,,"In a normal deck, this is not great. You get 2-for-1ed and the couple life you gain doesn't make up for that. In a deck with a lot of good sacrifice fodder, this is premium removal, which is nice because you may pick them up quite late. As long as you have enough Burglar Rats and Muse Drakes, this will do the trick."
86,Spinal Centipede,grn,black,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Spinal Centipede.png,2.5,,"This doesn't turn the dial up to 11, but it's no slouch either. This is an above-average playable, and it'll make the cut most of the time. As long as you have enough creatures that you aren't wasting the death trigger very often, this gives you enough stats for 3 mana that it's worth a slot."
87,Undercity Necrolisk,grn,black,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Undercity Necrolisk.png,1.5,,"Once again, how much sacrifice fodder you have determines how good this is. I do like that it's a 3/3 for 4 base, but that alone doesn't make it an exciting addition. Sorcery-speed sacrifice is also a lot worse than instant, as this won't fizzle removal spells or get you value off chump blocks, so beware when comparing this to other sacrifice effects."
88,Veiled Shade,grn,black,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Veiled Shade.png,1.5,,"I can't imagine being excited to put this into my deck. I'm not trying to throw shade-it's just not very efficient, and not that big to start with. If you're really lacking mana sinks, this could get there, but I hope that you can do better."
89,Vicious Rumors,grn,black,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Vicious Rumors.png,0,,"Please, just trust me-this isn't worth 1 mana, no matter how many different (minor) things it does. This is exactly the kind of card that looks super appealing, but besides the discard, all of the other effects aren't worth anything (and in the case of milling them for one, can actually be a disadvantage)."
90,Whispering Snitch,grn,black,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Whispering Snitch.png,2.5,,"There's enough surveil in the format that this will basically always be good in Dimir, and can sometimes even be great. If you're Golgari, it drops off some, but once you have 3-4 surveil cards and a need for early defense, this is worth including."
91,Arclight Phoenix,grn,red,mythic,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Arclight Phoenix.png,3.5,,"A Snapping Drake with haste is good enough already, and given enough jump-start cards, you may even be able to get this back (if you're lucky). Either way, I'll take a good aggressive flyer with upside, and would be glad to play this in Boros or a beatdown Izzet deck."
92,Barging Sergeant,grn,red,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Barging Sergeant.png,2,,"Boros decks won't have room for that many 5-drops, so I'm not that high on this.

94,Command the Storm,grn,red,common,instant,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Command the Storm.png,3,,"Being an instant goes a long way-we'd play it no matter what, but at least now it's got some flexibility to it. I'd rather have this in my 5-drop spot than almost any creature, so I'm fine taking this one early. Plus, as with any color that touches Izzet, spells have a slight bonus thanks to the various cards that care about them."
95,Cosmotronic Wave,grn,red,common,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Cosmotronic Wave.png,2.5,,"Aggressive decks love this one weird trick, as it gets lethal through and picks off small creatures, all in one card.

96,Direct Current,grn,red,common,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Direct Current.png,3,,"This card wasn't quite priced to move, but it's great anyway. It can kill two small creatures or one large one, all at the cost of an extra land or useless card. This also can go to the face, so keep that in mind when deciding how aggressively you should chump block."
97,Electrostatic Field,grn,red,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Electrostatic Field.png,1,,"In a heavy spells deck, this fulfills the role of defender and of finisher, all in one. I'm still a little skeptical of 0/X defenders in a land of mentor, but repeatable, unblockable damage is a nice thing to have on a 2-drop. This is no Thermo-Alchemist, as it doesn't get a free point of damage every turn as a baseline, which is what's keeping it from being a 3.0."
98,Erratic Cyclops,grn,red,rare,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Erratic Cyclops.png,3.5,,"Erratic Cyclops is huge, and can attack for large (and appropriately erratic) sums of damage. This is fantastic in a spells deck and pretty solid on defense even in a deck light on spells. The only place I wouldn't want it would be in an aggressive Boros deck that doesn't have enough spells to enable it (you want 6+, some of which are expensive)."
99,Experimental Frenzy,grn,red,rare,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Experimental Frenzy.png,3.5,,"I think this card is great. I'm not sure, because it's weird as hell, but it looks like it would be awesome in a deck with a low curve. Getting to play lands off the top helps you multi-spell, and if you ever get stuck with too many cards in hand, you can get rid of this. I definitely am going to need to experiment with this, but I think it's a good one."

101,Fire Urchin,grn,red,common,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Fire Urchin.png,1,,"In a spell-heavy deck, this is a serviceable 2-drop. It blocks well enough and can attack as a 2/3 or 3/3 later in the game. That's not exciting, but even the brilliant Izzet need someone to clean up after their experiments, or run errands, picking up whatever weird crap they need to run experiments with."
102,Goblin Banneret,grn,red,uncommon,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Goblin Banneret.png,2.5,,"I like this in an aggressive Boros deck. It attacks for real damage, and often will trade with something while giving you a +1/+1 counter for your troubles. Remember to pump this before attacks if you have something to mentor on to, as it won't even trigger if there aren't any legal targets."
103,Goblin Cratermaker,grn,red,uncommon,,removal,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobmattsson/mtg-cards/master/images/grn/Goblin Cratermaker.png,3,,"Shock and Shatter on a stick is a good deal, especially when that stick is a 2/2 for 2 that can attack and block early in the game. I'd play this in any deck, and would take it early to boot. The flexibility and efficiency have me sold, though it would read better if it just said ""artifact"" for the second ability (I know, I know, Eldrazi in older formats makes it relevant)."

Note that it does not deal damage to creatures, so it's really just a fancy Lava Axe (or two). This can be fizzled by bounce or removal on the creature, so in an ideal world you'd target something that's under Luminous Bonds or Capture Sphere to mitigate that."

If your offense isn't performing, this does basically nothing, but if you are pressuring the opponent, this puts them between a rock and a hard place.
