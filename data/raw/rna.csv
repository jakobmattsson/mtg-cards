If you can get +3/+3, the card is quite strong, and it's not that hard to imagine getting there.",white,rna

Not only is this a huge flash flyer that is cheap and great at ambushing, it can also save you in even the most dire situations. You could take a lot away from this card and it would still be great, which is a sign of a true bomb. If you draw this early, you can pick off an attacker and start smashing the opponent. Later in the game, it saves you from lethal, and you may even want to trade this off (or chump) so that you can go back up to 10 on your next turn. This is a great card, and one that does well in almost any situation.",white,rna

I'm excited about the Gate deck, as it looks like it's getting a lot of solid payoffs this time around.",white,rna
Arrester's Zeal,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492211/large/en_uxKbeQbht1.png?1547237510,2.5,,"I like Arrester's Zeal quite a bit. 1 mana for a +2/+2 is usually a solid playable, and giving it potential as a finisher really pushes this over the top. The only thing that quenches my zeal a little is that both Azorius and Orzhov have some defensive aspects to them, which makes combat tricks a bit less appealing. Still, the rate on this is quite good, and I suspect it'll be a card you're happy to play.",white,rna
Bring to Trial,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492213/large/en_6pf7JYnBRB.png?1547237665,2.5,,"At 3 mana I'm likely to main deck the first copy of this almost every time.

Civic Stalwart,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492216/large/en_aAsie0k4db.png?1547237824,2.5,,"The floor on this is pretty high-it's a 3/3 for 4, which is at least a card. In the best case scenario, it leads to a ton of damage, both via the extra power and the fact that it enables your 2/2s to attack into 3/3s. The more aggressive you are, the better this gets, but it's a fine playable in your average midrange deck too. It is very important to have a curve to maximize this, so focus on getting good 2s and 3s if you have a couple of Stalwarts.",white,rna

I'm usually in for the first of these, and even two of them are solid if your curve needs to be lower. It just happens that these stats and cost are a good combination, and with all the 1/1 flyers from afterlife, this could be even better than normal.",white,rna

It won't be hard to make a couple of tokens over the course of the game, and once you get the first one you are already profiting well. This does lend itself to an aggressive deck, but even in a control deck it's going to be a solid performer, as you can use it to generate a stream of chump blockers.",white,rna

Knight of Sorrows,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492280/large/en_Y5SXwmkuEt.png?1547256070,2,,"To my great sorrow, you can only play so many 5-drops in your deck. That said, this is a good one, as it will often trade off and net you a 1/1 in the process. It's also a nice last-ditch defender, as it can step in front of two huge monsters and buy you a ton of time.",white,rna

I'm not obliged to like everything that provides card advantage, but I do like this one.

Rally to Battle,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492078/large/rna-18-rally-to-battle.jpg?1547311372,2.5,3.5,"In a creature-heavy deck, this has a very high ceiling. When it's good, it will often be great, as you can easily get a 2- or 3-for-1 in combat. It's pretty sweet that attacking with everything is hard to punish, since the opponent can't even attack back without getting ambushed. The average deck will play this, and aggressive decks full of creatures will rally love it.",white,rna
Resolute Watchdog,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492284/large/en_aIh0K1lCT6.png?1547256227,3,,"This is a really good dog.

If you land it and win a combat, having a +1/+2 and vigilance left over is huge. It also gives you the option of mainphasing it for a big life swing, and the two options together make a potent card indeed. Mark my words-this is the real deal.",white,rna
Sky Tether,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492286/large/en_Bsyf40Ogre.png?1547256303,3,,"Ground-based attack decks won't want this, but everyone else will (control decks and flyer decks most prominently).

Summary Judgment,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492288/large/en_JOwgSKLFk7.png?1547256354,3,,"This is a defensive removal spell, but it's cheap enough and effective enough that I don't see cutting it unless your deck is both very aggressive and has no flyers.

The Guard was bad in Guilds of Ravnica, and the Veteran here isn't much better. Untapping your own creatures during your attack step isn't that valuable, and a 2/3 for 3 is not a good set of stats.",white,rna

Plus, every now and then this will make combat tricks or removal hard for your opponent to cast, which is just gravy.",white,rna
Twilight Panther,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492294/large/en_5JHUQQrqKb.png?1547256880,2,,"This is essentially a gold card, and a solid one at that. It's at its best against Gruul and Simic, but will do decent defensive work in most matchups.",white,rna

It's almost always going to be cast with the addendum bonus, but in a pinch can be used to save your team. Giving your whole squad a permanent +1/+1 bonus and getting a risk-free attack is huge, making this a great card in any creature-heavy deck.",white,rna
Watchful Giant,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492296/large/en_lNxxJWYKqs.png?1547257119,1.5,,"While this is a fine deal for 6 mana, there just isn't a pressing need to pick 6-drops early, and I suspect this will be pretty replaceable.

Benthic Biomancer,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6491960/large/636825596278439261.png?1546993534,2.5,,"The Biomancer is a fine card on its own, if unexciting (3 mana for a 2/2 plus a loot isn't too crazy). Where it gets interesting is when you have ways to add more counters, as it gives you more looting triggers, which is a powerful engine. I'd look to combine this with Combine Guildmage, which will give you a steady stream of counters and action.",blue,rna
Chillbringer,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492298/large/en_5vcFwsE7RB.png?1547257181,3.5,,"This card has no chill, despite the name. It's a large flying threat that locks down the opponent's best creature for a turn (and stops two turns of blocks), which is awesome in aggressive and control decks alike. Multiples of these stack well, and this looks like one of the best commons in the set.",blue,rna
Clear the Mind,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492300/large/en_UQmzEhd1mg.png?1547257235,1,,"While it may be clear that I'll try and prevent myself from decking with this, that's not a game plan I can recommend in good conscience. Maybe you can sideboard this in a control mirror, but for the most part it shouldn't make it off the bench.",blue,rna
Code of Constraint,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492302/large/en_wX4oPTSsP2.png?1547257308,3,,"Code of Constraint plays as two different cards, and both are good. It's either a combat trick that offers a 2-for-1, or a way to lock down an opposing creature without losing a card. I like how addendum is used on this card, and I'm happy playing as many copies as I can get.",blue,rna
Coral Commando,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492304/large/en_v7DuODLkpC.png?1547257377,1,,Bad stats and no abilities makes this a fishy inclusion in any deck.,blue,rna

The casting cost is obviously the issue here, as the card is quite powerful. A 2-mana counter that buffs one of your units and has +1/+1 counter synergies is great, but UU means you won't be able to cast this turn 2 some of the time, and that's a big hit. Once you're looking at 9+ blue sources, I'd bump this up a little, but early in the Draft I wouldn't prioritize it.",blue,rna
Eyes Everywhere,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492110/large/636827453917174527.png?1547149879,1,,"I don't think Eyes Everywhere is particularly good. It costs a lot of mana to steal a creature, and leaves the opponent with a permanent scry 1 each turn. If the opponent has blue mana, things get worse, as they might start swapping this back and forth. That can lead to a weird lock where that's all players do, but even then I don't think this is really a card you want in your deck. If your opponent has insane creatures you can't deal with and isn't playing blue, maybe this is a sideboard card, but I'm not really going to be keeping an eye on this one.",blue,rna
Faerie Duelist,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492306/large/en_KIzvi2jc2N.png?1547257429,3,,"I like this little guy (though he'd probably poke me for saying that). You can win combats when your 2/2 or 3/3 runs into theirs, and on defense flashing this in and double blocking lets you take down something bigger (sometimes without losing anything). Having a 1/2 flyer as a leftover isn't bad, and I think this pesky bug will be a solid playable.",blue,rna
Gateway Sneak,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6492308/large/en_dpJ2Xg3zLm.png?1547257486,2.5,3.5,"This is a build-around, but an extreme one. I'd play this in any deck with even two Gates, as a 1/3 that draws a card on damage makes all your bounce and removal spells very dangerous. Once you have 5+ Gates it becomes a sick threat and can take over a game with ease. Don't assume only the Gate deck wants this-it'll go quickly in most any Draft.",blue,rna
Humongulus,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6491819/large/636822295686525048.jpg?1546735139,1.5,,"There aren't a ton of enticing Auras, which makes me a lot less inclined to run the Humongulus (great name notwithstanding). Against a ground-based aggro deck with more removal and fewer pump spells, this can be a great sideboard card, and it can (eventually) kill a control deck if need be. It's filler, but filler that does at least have high upside.",blue,rna
Mass Manipulation,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6491835/large/rna-42-mass-manipulation.jpg?1546736457,3,4,"The split ratings here are to convey how good this is in a normal blue deck versus how good this is in a deck built for the late game. Paying 6 mana (4 of which is blue) to steal one creature is still pretty good, and most decks can swing that as long as you play like 10 Islands. Where this becomes a flat-out bomb is when you make a ramp/control deck with a lot of defensive measures, and reliably can cast this to take two creatures. That's almost impossible to beat, and a very big incentive to build such a deck.",blue,rna

Even if you discount my soft spot for octopi, this card is just a beating. A 4/5 hexproof for 5 with upside is awesome, and the Illusions give you a lot of breathing room. You'll often want to chump with one and conserve the other, just so hexproof sticks around, but no matter how you use this it will be great.",blue,rna

Pteramander,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6491996/large/rna-47-pteramander.jpg?1547255304,3,,"I like Pteramander, even if you aren't going to activate it for much less than 5 or 6.

By itself, it's 5 mana to draw a card and keep a creature off your back, which is a complementary pair of abilities.

Where Act of Treason really shines (and gets a 3.0 rating) is in a deck with multiple ways to sacrifice creatures.

You can even attack with this when they have two blockers, and they will often be forced to block this and let everything else through, which turns into a ton of damage.

In a deck with spectacle cards, Spear Spewer is an auto-play and a great way to make your deck work. That puts it into solid 3 territory because the decks that want it really want it. It isn't great in control or midrange decks without spectacle nonsense, so keep that in mind, but the effect here is powerful enough (even if symmetrical) that I'd take this early. As a side note, I don't find this kind of card (Goblin Fireslinger being the earlier example) to be very interesting when they enable spectacle/bloodthirst. The ability is just always on when this is in play, and there's nothing the opponent can do about it. That's not very good game play, and I don't see why this has to be a common at such a good rate.",red,rna

Unless the opponent has instant-speed interaction, it immediately gives you a pair of 3/3s, and the turn after you likely can add another Ooze to the board. That leaves you with two 4/4s and a 3/3, and it just gets better from there. If this does get answered, you traded 1-for-1 and either have a 2/2 or 3/3 left over, depending on when the opponent killed it. A card that wins the game if it isn't killed, trades advantageously against removal, and can help mount a comeback, all for 5 mana, gets a high grade in my book.",green,rna

By itself, it gives you six +1/+1 counters, and each counter you already have gives you a bonus one. That's a lot of stats to throw around, making this a very threatening card if you have any kind of board presence at all. This isn't the best in a control deck, as it's not great when you are behind, but in any midrange or aggressive deck it will do good work.",green,rna

I'm not usually high on 8-drops, but when they win you the game almost every time, I am willing to change my tune. This easily hits for 11+ damage, and it can be much more than that if the board is stalled, which is worth the effort it takes to get to 8 mana.
