Anointed Deacon,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379421/large/145775_200w.jpg?1505504605,2,,"This is a solid way to top off your curve in an aggressive Vampire deck, and works exceptionally well with 1/1 lifelink tokens. Being able to throw a creature a turn at them and force trades is good, and at the very worst this attacks as a 5/3.",black,xln
Bishop of the Bloodstained,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6378913/large/bishop.png?1505510095,1.5,3,"In a deck with a light Vampire theme, this doesn't do a lot. It's passable, but you really want to make a huge bloody mess, not just sprinkle a little onto the ground. In a dedicated Vampire deck, this looks like an awesome finisher, and I can imagine it doing 4+ damage easily. Make those tokens and reap the rewards.",black,xln
Blight Keeper,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379425/large/145777_200w.jpg?1505504617,1,,"Here's one of the 1/1 flyers for 1 that I try to keep you from playing. I can see this being playable in a raid deck, but outside of that it doesn't do enough early and the ability is too expensive to rely on later.",black,xln
Bloodcrazed Paladin,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6375435/large/142008_200w.jpg?1503948898,3,,"Off just one trade, this is a 3/3 for 2 mana, and that's not all that hard to accomplish. If you can go bigger than that, you are really doing it, and with some clever maneuvering, you can get a very good deal.",black,xln
Boneyard Parley,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6375436/large/142009_200w.jpg?1503948900,3,,"Zombie or Fiction seems like a good card to me. It does cost 7 and requires there to have been five creatures killed, but by the time you can cast it that doesn't seem like too tall an order. At that point, you either get two good creatures or three decent ones, assuming the creatures that have died aren't all abysmal. I think that's worth 7 mana and at the top end of a control curve, it could help finish games. You can actually cast it with fewer than five creatures, but it loses a lot of value at that point.",black,xln
Contract Killing,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379524/large/145779_200w.jpg?1505504808,3.5,,"Unconditional kill is a fine deal at 4, so paying 5 and getting two Treasures is a contract worth signing. This is playable in every deck but especially good in ramp, so be on the lookout for that strategy if you can pick up a couple.",black,xln
Costly Plunder,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379525/large/145780_200w.jpg?1505504810,1,,"This is a little too much work to draw two cards, and I love drawing two cards. Sacrificing a Treasure token is cute, and eating Vampire tokens is fine, but I'm not looking to run this very often. I do like siding it against Aura-based removal, so keep that in mind.",black,xln
Dark Nourishment,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379526/large/145781_200w.jpg?1505504811,3,,"Dark Nourishment at uncommon is a bit surprising, but it's still a fine removal spell and you'll always play it. Being an instant is a relevant upgrade over similar cards we've seen in the past, and against all of the non-Dinosaur decks this should kill whatever needs killing.",black,xln
Deadeye Tormentor,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6376304/large/144533_200w.jpg?1504290496,2,,"If you can reliably attack and trigger this, it's both efficient and annoying for your opponent. I wouldn't be dead set on playing it in a midrange deck, and likely wouldn't play it in a control deck, because missing the raid trigger makes this the height of mediocrity.",black,xln
Deadeye Tracker,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6375440/large/142010_200w.jpg?1503948909,3.5,,"All this needs is a little action, and then it can start to go on all sorts of expeditions. With Deadeye Tracker in play, you are by default winning the war of attrition, making it a must-kill threat in all but the fastest games. That's a great deal for just 1 mana, and I'm likely to slam this anytime I have the option to.",black,xln
Deathless Ancient,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6377532/large/144791_200w.jpg?1504650137,3,,"Overpaying by 1 mana isn't too bad when you factor in the ability to rise from the grave. In a dedicated Vampire deck this is the perfect finisher, and given all the ways to make tokens, it seems like it shouldn't be too hard to assemble the necessary squad. I'd still play this outside of a Vampire deck if you are lacking finishers, though it does lose a lot of its luster.",black,xln
Desperate Castaways,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379440/large/145782_200w.jpg?1505504662,2,,"These work well in a defensive deck and are roused to fight at the sight of Treasure, which makes them good in most U/B decks as well. I'm not desperate to pick them up, but I'll be happy to play them more often than not. Later in the Draft, their value can increase as well if you've got a lot of artifacts or are lacking 2s.",black,xln
Dire Fleet Hoarder,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379441/large/145783_200w.jpg?1505504664,2,,"Decks that want 2/1s don't usually have a super high curve, but Treasure is valuable for every deck, even if it's better with 6+ drops. This looks like a solid way to make sure you have early plays, and has decent value up until the very late game.",black,xln
Dire Fleet Interloper,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379527/large/145784_200w.jpg?1505504813,2.5,,"I'm a huge fan of all of the explore cards, though this one is a tick below auto-play because of how badly it fares on defense. It's still a good card, and one you will play almost every time, but in a control deck you can't always afford to spend 4 mana on a creature with a mostly offensive slant.",black,xln
Dire Fleet Ravager,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6378926/large/Dire-Fleet-Ravager-Ixalan-Spoiler.png?1505253898,3.5,,"While this does ravage your life total as well as the opponent's, if you play this while you have the initiative it does a ton of work. A 4/4 menace deathtouch is a beater, and blocking it means losing two solid creatures, while being very exposed to combat tricks. If I see this early I'm taking it and drafting aggro, and I'd still play it in all but the most controlling decks.",black,xln
Duress,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6378002/large/145251_200w.jpg?1504822902,0.5,,"Like Spell Pierce, this is another Constructed staple that's relegated to sideboard duty in Limited. The odds of whiffing are just too high to maindeck this, though it can be effective against spell-heavy decks.",black,xln
Fathom Fleet Captain,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6375447/large/142011_200w.jpg?1503948926,3.5,,"Not only is a 2/1 menace for 2 a good deal on its face, this snowballs out of control quickly if you can enable it. I can't fathom not picking this early, and even later in the Draft it's worth trying to make work. Plus, the fail case is so good that you can run this with as few as 1-2 other Pirates and feel good about it.",black,xln
Fathom Fleet Cutthroat,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379445/large/145786_200w.jpg?1505504671,2,,"This existing will greatly increase the success rate of bluff attacks, as sending 1/1s into 3/3s looks mighty suspicious. Given the raid mechanic, it's good to keep people on their toes, and this does a lot of work even if you don't have it in your hand (or deck). That said, the ability is solid, though definitely on the aggressive side, and it won't go off against crafty opponents as often as you'd like. This also is a card you can side out after showing it to the opponent, as it will impact their play in subsequent games.",black,xln
Grim Captain's Call,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379456/large/145787_200w.jpg?1505504689,1,3,"Can I call this Tidings, or is that too much? In a deck where you are only getting one creature back, this is unplayable, but it gets pretty good once you are up to two or three reliably. Most decks won't be that diverse, but if you get the mixed bag tribal deck, this will make things grim for your opponent. Drawing three creatures for 3 mana is awesome, and if you get the full four I think you should get to declare victory.",black,xln
Heartless Pillage,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379530/large/145789_200w.jpg?1505504818,2.5,,"I'm a fan of Mind Rot in general, and Mind Rot with a Treasure attached is a great deal. Even in decks with few creatures, this will have high points, and midrange decks can make very good use of this card. I wouldn't always slam it in aggro since discarding two isn't an effect they care about a ton, so this is not quite an auto-play.",black,xln
Kitesail Freebooter,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6377652/large/144958_200w.jpg?1504729698,3,,"A Duress with a 1/2 flyer attached is much more interesting, even if it's not a complete freeroll, as the opponent can get their card back with a removal spell. Still, I'd always maindeck this, especially in Pirate/raid decks, and side it out if I saw that my opponent didn't have many targets.",black,xln
Lurking Chupacabra,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6378915/large/chupa.png?1505510216,2,,"I love that there is now a (the) Chupacabra, as it's a sweet piece of lore to exist in Magic. The game play is solid too, and I'd play this in any deck with 3+ ways to explore. Once you are at 5+, it becomes awesome, though it sucks if you aren't triggering the ability at least once.",black,xln
March of the Drowned,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379472/large/145791_200w.jpg?1505504716,2.5,,"I'm a big fan of this card. It's elegant, it plays well, and it's powerful in the right deck, while not being a total miss if things don't line up for it. I'd play this in any deck with 4+ Pirates, and if you have some awesome creatures, you can just run it as Raise Dead without feeling bad.",black,xln
Mark of the Vampire,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/863136/large/markofvamp.jpg?1373813655,1.5,,"Slamming this on an evasive creature or something with hexproof is a big game, and does go a long way in making up for the inherent weakness of Auras (they open you up to getting 2-for-1'd by removal and are dead if you don't have a good target). I think this will make its mark in decks with specific targets, and is a fine sideboard card against removal-light opponents. Likewise, feel free to take it out against decks with ample removal and bounce.",black,xln
Queen's Agent,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379489/large/145796_200w.jpg?1505504744,2,,"This is an explorer that really wants to get that +1/+1 counter, especially since you don't really need lands once you've already hit six. I like this as high end, though it can be outclassed by Dinosaurs fairly easily. I also like adding more lifelinkers to the Vampire clan, as it gives you more and more incentives to run pump spells.",black,xln
Queen's Bay Soldier,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6377543/large/144862_200w.jpg?1504650158,1.5,,"If you need a 2-drop Vampire, old Bay here has your back. It's not the spiciest addition to your deck, but it's playable if your curve is in need of help.",black,xln
Raiders' Wake,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379118/large/145605_200w.jpg?1505405662,1.5,,"While this can make things look grim for the opponent, it does take a fair amount of work to do its thing. You have to be in a position to attack the opponent each turn, while spending 4 mana on a card that doesn't affect the board at all. For each game that this dominates (which will happen), I suspect there will be multiple games where it does little to nothing. Overall I'm willing to try it as a finisher/high end in a low-curve raid deck, but I'm not high on its prospects.",black,xln
Revel in Riches,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6375452/large/142012_200w.jpg?1503948944,0.5,,"You have to go real deep before this is a legit win condition, and getting a Treasure each time a creature dies isn't worth 5 mana. Obviously I'm going to try and win the game via the Mr. Moneybags route, but I revel in that sort of thing, and can't in good conscience recommend it.",black,xln
Ruin Raider,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6375457/large/142013_200w.jpg?1503948956,3.5,,"Greatness at a very low cost-all you need to do is attack with a 2-drop and play this on 3 to get great value, and I'd play this in any deck with a reasonable amount of creatures. Note that it isn't optional, but attacking is. This is better in aggressive decks (duh) but it's powerful enough and cheap enough that it's good outside of them too.",black,xln
Ruthless Knave,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379119/large/145606_200w.jpg?1505405665,2.5,,"The stats on this make it playable, and the ability gives you a decent way to spend your time and mana. It gets quite a bit better in a token-based deck or one full of Treasure generators, but the rate of exchange is never so efficient that you really feel like you're getting away with anything. It at least isn't sorcery speed, so blocking and sacrificing can be a good way to get value.",black,xln
Sanctum Seeker,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6377656/large/144967_200w.jpg?1504729712,4,,"I'm in for a non-hasty Hellrider that has the upside of being larger and draining the opponent instead of just pinging them. You do need to draft around it, but given how many Vampire tokens there are running around, that seems quite doable. This is also playable all by itself, so don't expect to see it late even if your neighbors aren't in Vampires.",black,xln
Seeker's Squire,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379498/large/145798_200w.jpg?1505504759,3.5,,"Cheap explore creatures are great, and this is no exception. It's either a 2/3 for 2 that scryed, or a 1/2 that draws a card. That's all you can ask from a 2-drop, and no deck would ever cut this.",black,xln
Skittering Heartstopper,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6378359/large/145271_200w.jpg?1504901309,1.5,,"This is a cheap raid enabler and a way to handle large creatures, though it's inefficient against small or medium threats. I like it as a sideboard card against Dinos, or a way to make sure your raid cards are active (though watch out for clever opponents blocking and making you spend a mana).",black,xln
Skulduggery,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379538/large/145799_200w.jpg?1505504832,3,,"I really like how this is going to play. It rewards good combat decisions, and can even pick up a 2-for-1 if you get to kill a 1-toughness creature and win a fight. I'd maindeck up to two without a second thought, even if sometimes you do need to side them out.",black,xln
Skymarch Bloodletter,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379539/large/145800_200w.jpg?1505504833,3,,"An efficient flyer with a drain 1 attached sounds good to me, and I don't imagine this will be riding the sideboard very often. I suppose some control decks might not be looking for this level of aggression, but pretty much everyone else will.",black,xln
Spreading Rot,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379540/large/145801_200w.jpg?1505504835,0.5,,"Besides rotting in your hand, this will also rot in your sideboard. I do see some value in siding this against the rare flip lands, but past that it's a pass.",black,xln
Sword-Point Diplomacy,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379543/large/145802_200w.jpg?1505504840,1,,"Even in the most aggressive deck, this has a pretty bad fail case. The opponent can let you have ineffective or mediocre cards (or lands), and only pay life if they really need to stop something. In any deck that isn't attacking, this is worse than useless.",black,xln
Vanquish the Weak,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379544/large/145803_200w.jpg?1505504842,3,,"This hits targets in every deck and does so at instant speed, which is a deal I'll take for 3 mana. Much like every other conditional removal, there is some risk when you have multiples, but unless I was completely smothered in these, I wouldn't worry about it.",black,xln
Vicious Conquistador,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6378920/large/Vicious-Conquistador-Ixalan-Spoiler.png?1505510491,1,,"A single 2/2 and this has to stop attacking, which makes it significantly less vicious than advertised. This is more of a Constructed card than a Limited one, though I can see it making the cut (slash?) in very aggressive Vampire decks.",black,xln
Vraska's Contempt,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6375469/large/142014_200w.jpg?1503948981,4,,"Extra unconditional removal that even gets around all sorts of things is well worth 4 mana, and this gains you 2 life to boot. I'm in.",black,xln
Walk the Plank,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6377551/large/144888_200w.jpg?1504650176,4,,"Unless you're unlucky enough to play against the all-Merfolk deck, this is going to be excellent. It's cheap, basically unconditional, and certainly an early pick.",black,xln
Wanted Scoundrels,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6377661/large/144978_200w.jpg?1504729727,3.5,,"Every now and then, this is going to backfire, but most of the time it's going to be great. The drawback becomes smaller in the late game, and the early game power here is hard to ignore. As long as you don't play against the deck full of Lightning Strikes, this is a wanted card indeed.",black,xln
Ancient Brontodon,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379420/large/145670_200w.jpg?1505504602,1,,"I get it-this is huge, and dreams of smashing with ginormous Brontodons is very appealing. That doesn't change the fact that this costs 8 mana, has no protection from removal, and does nothing if it gets bounced or killed. If you really need a ramp payoff, certainly nobody else will, and you can pick up ol' bronty just fine.",green,xln
Atzocan Archer,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379422/large/145726_200w.jpg?1505504608,3,,"I like the combo of a solid defender and a nice little ping ability. This will pick off 2/1s, stop 3/3 flyers, and can even trigger your 2/3 or 3/2 enrage creatures (being able to fight your own creatures is uncommon).",green,xln
Blinding Fog,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379426/large/145727_200w.jpg?1505504620,0.5,,"I'm not a big fan of fogs in general, and this can't even save you from dying to an alpha strike (only prevents damage to creatures). It does protect your creatures from removal, but that's not enough to blind me to how bad this is.",green,xln
Blossom Dryad,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379427/large/145728_200w.jpg?1505504623,2.5,,"As long as your curve has a decent amount of 5+ drops, this is a fine addition. In a beatdown deck, I'd leave it by the wayside, but otherwise I'm in.",green,xln
Carnage Tyrant,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6375439/large/142022_200w.jpg?1503948906,4,,"Apparently this is a lot more mythic than Scaled Behemoth, but I guess being uncounterable and getting trample goes a long way. Regardless of the rarity symbol, this will cause carnage, as it's impossible to stop except via combat, and big enough that it's hard even with creatures. It's nice being able to tap out and slam this, and know that almost nothing can go wrong.",green,xln
Colossal Dreadmaw,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379432/large/145730_200w.jpg?1505504640,2.5,,"This is slightly worse than Carnage Tyrant, mainly because of the worse stats and the lack of great abilities. It's still a perfectly acceptable finisher, and a card I'll play multiples of in a ramp deck. It doesn't even sound bad to play one in a red-green beatdown deck, as a 6/6 trample is no laughing matter for the opponent.",green,xln
Commune with Dinosaurs,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6378351/large/145263_200w.jpg?1504901294,2,,"In a deck with 10+ Dinosaurs, this provides a good amount of flexibility. A 1 mana spell that can find you lands or threats, depending on what you need, is valuable. The price is that you need Dinosaurs, or this becomes a glorified land, but once you pay that price this is a good addition. It also has what I assume is a playtest name that somehow slipped through, but that doesn't affect game play.",green,xln
Crash the Ramparts,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379433/large/145732_200w.jpg?1505504643,1.5,,"Crash the Ramparts lives up to its name, as it will let you crash through for the final points of damage effectively. It's expensive enough that you don't get a ton of value in the early/midgame as you end up spending your whole turn on it, so I wouldn't prioritize it. You want one of these to finish things off, but aren't going to feel too bad if you don't get it.",green,xln

Deathgorge Scavenger,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379435/large/145737_200w.jpg?1505504648,3,,"Deathgorge Scavenger is oozing with value. It's a 3/2 that will often gain 2 life right away, and can attack as a 4/3 or gain additional life over the course of the game. It's not a bomb, since the buff isn't permanent and it does require cards in graveyards, but it's a nice value creature that you will always play.",green,xln
Deeproot Champion,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6375441/large/142023_200w.jpg?1503948911,1.5,3.5,"In the right deck, this could be one of your best cards, though green-based spell decks are few and far between. Most of the time this will play as a 1/1 that becomes a 2/2 or 3/3 eventually, which is fine if you are Merfolk and probably not good enough otherwise. I'd want 10 or more spells before I started really getting excited here.",green,xln
Deeproot Warrior,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6379436/large/145738_200w.jpg?1505504652,2.5,,"While strictly a beatdown card, Deeproot Warrior does its job, and does its job well. It gets in without fear, and will be a sought-after part of any aggressive strategy. This is a good card to be aware of since it's quite the on-the-board trick if you block with a 2/2. I expect its kill count to be high at the prerelease.",green,xln
Drover of the Mighty,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6377650/large/144950_200w.jpg?1504729693,3.5,,"This may seem like a mighty high grade, but a mana Elf (Druid) that becomes a relevant body later is a really big deal.

Emperor's Vanguard,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6375445/large/142024_200w.jpg?1503948919,3.5,,"This hits pretty hard, as getting through even once adds a ton of value. It's also a solid 4/3 for 4, so you aren't even paying for the ability. I'd take this, and I'd prioritize ways to get it through once I had it.",green,xln

It's a 6-drop that catches you up instantly by setting your life to 15, which means that you can be aggressive about taking damage early. Once you untap, you get to hunt down their biggest creature, and continue down the line, though if your life total gets low, you might start eating small things instead. The drawback is that you have to fight, so your primal instincts may get you killed if they keep playing creatures. The key with this is to end the game after playing it, which makes it a little different than most control finishers. The power level is here, but you do need some creatures to close out the game before you run out of life points. It's also nice with life gain, and bounce/removal can help you avoid dying to the ability. Of note, you can also target a creature then bounce or kill it with a spell in response, which will prevent you from taking the damage.",red,rix

It's no Mesa Pegasus (banding is unreal-don't look it up unless you have a lot of time), but it's good on turn 2 and good late with pump spells.",white,dom
On Serra's Wings,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6429356/large/en_A7fSaQiVVp.png?1523639451,3.5,,"I'm coming in high on this because of how much of a payoff it is. Often, it will be good even if you only get one hit in. If you can slap this on something and have it live, you likely just win the game. It does lose some luster in removal-heavy matchups, but I doubt I'd side this out unless they were packing some real heat.",white,dom
Pegasus Courser,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6433136/large/en_4oFhp1ufEU.png?1523639492,3,,"Aggressive white decks will play this as a matter of course, and even defensive decks can get behind a 1/3 flyer for 3. This can play defense until it's time to end the game, at which point it can get things over with very quickly. I actually like the stats on this a lot, as it makes it a much more interesting card than the 2/1 version.",white,dom
Sanctum Spirit,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6433189/large/en_YYH1LcppuW.png?1523639600,3,,"I could see giving this a bump if you have 5+ historic cards to discard, because a 0-mana protection spell is a huge swing. If you can imagine playing this on turn 4, and discarding a card after blocking their 3-drop, you really are getting into the spirit of things. In fact, I bet most opponents won't attack into this or block when you attack, which makes this a high-value play even with no support (though the effect is lessened in games 2 and 3, assuming the opponent pays attention to your plays).",white,dom
Seal Away,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6429374/large/en_OjnAVXQc6n.png?1523639611,3.5,,"A 2-mana Assassinate is sweet, and making it an instant is an enormous upgrade. This does lose a little luster in aggro, but it's so efficient that I'm never turning it down.",white,dom
Sergeant-at-Arms,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6433190/large/en_xXCdkMhiJD.png?1523639636,3,,"I love kicker. A powerful 6-mana play that you can also run out on 3 is great, and I am totally behind more of these being printed. This gets even better when you have go-wide support, but don't get me wrong-this is great in any white deck.",white,dom
Serra Angel,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6431795/large/en_z41XnLAgmJ.png?1523639650,4,,"Serra is a classic-she plays both sides of the court, and does so with power and grace.",white,dom

"Shalai, Voice of Plenty",http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6431796/large/en_JKoZ9yLSGN.png?1523639687,4.5,,"In a nongreen deck, this is ""just"" a 4.0, but adding an insanely powerful late-game ability makes me very happy. The hexproof line is kind of flavor text because your opponent will want to kill this first anyway, but it can protect your creatures from situational removal that may not be able to hit Shalai. She's plenty good regardless, and I shall be happy first-picking her.",white,dom

Casting 0-mana Resurrections is a big game, and she generates a ton of value when left unchecked. If you can, try to save her until you can play her and a cheap historic spell in the same turn.",white,dom

If your deck is creature-light, maybe skip this, but even in midrange or control I'd run this as a finisher if I had enough creatures.",white,dom
Urza's Ruinous Blast,http://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6429440/large/en_Kboi7iP8ek.png?1523640049,1,3.5,"In a deck without support, this is literally uncastable. That isn't good. In a deck with 5+ legendary permanents, it can be awesome, though it does get ruined if the opponent has sick legends of their own. My guess is that this isn't worth going after from pick one, but can provide a good angle of attack in a deck that already has a few legends by the time you see this.",white,dom
